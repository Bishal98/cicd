# DevOps Assessment #

Hello and thank you for your interest in applying to A&A Engineering’s DevOp role. We have devised a short assessment in order to assure the quality of our candidates.
We have created a minimal C# project to test your ability to set up a Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment pipeline.

Using Jenkins, or another automation software, set up a pipeline that compiles the master branch of this repository (you will need to use MSBuild for this). Once compiled you should then upload the resulting exe to a specific FTP address. The address and its access credentials will be given to you in the assessment email; it is different for each candidate.
